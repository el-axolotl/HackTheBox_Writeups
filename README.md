# Introduction

I am currently a cybersecurity professional, and at the time of creating this repo, I am studying towards my CompTia PenTest+ certification.

The goal of these write-ups is to pair the theoretical knowledge I am gaining through CompTia's material, and coupling it with hands-on labs from HackTheBox. I hope to cement the skills I'm learning, by teaching them to you, who ever you may be.

I am not an ethical hacker / pen tester by any means, and the write-ups provided here are methods that worked for me to pwn machines from HackTheBox, and may not be the most effecient methods.
